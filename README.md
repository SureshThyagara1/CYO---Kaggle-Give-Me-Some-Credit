# CYO---Kaggle-Give-Me-Some-Credit
Harvard edx project
This project aims to develop prediction models on probable defaulters in 2 years. The data set used is from Kaggle named Give Me Some credit. This was originally a competition conducted on Kaggle in 2011. The closing dates were over in Dec. 2011. Here, we use the data set to display learing in the course by developing prediction models. At the end of it, we would also make a competition submission in the prescribed format.
The repository contains a .R script file, .RMD report file, pdf file of the report and also a csv file for competition submission.
